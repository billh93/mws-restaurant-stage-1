# Restaurant Stage 1 Project

Stage 1 objective is to convert a static restaurant webpage to a mobile-ready web application that is universally accessible to all users and create a seamless offline experience by utilizing service workers.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this program you will need the following:

1. Computer(Windows or Mac OS)
2. Python 3.6.0 >= Installed
3. Working knowledge of using the command-line

## Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

2. Run `grunt` to run the Grunt task.

3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
